# Strata 1.0.0 — agent usage guide

Strata is an embedded multi-model database: one binary, one file-backed
database, no server. Six primitives share one storage substrate with
branches and time travel: key-value, JSON documents, vectors, an event log,
graphs, and product spaces. This guide is generated from the installed
binary's own metadata, so it cannot drift from what `strata 1.0.0` does.

## Targeting a database

1. Explicit path or `--db <path>` — always wins: `strata ./my-db kv get k`
2. `STRATA_DB=<path>` — set once per session, used when no path is passed
3. `--cache` — explicit in-memory database (nothing persisted)

One-shot commands with no target refuse with
`invalid_argument.cli.no_database` — Strata never opens the current
directory implicitly. `strata <path>` with no command opens a REPL.

## Quickstart

```
strata ./my-db kv put greeting hello
strata ./my-db kv get greeting
strata --cache
strata agents guide
```

Branches fork cheaply and isolate writes; every primitive is branch-aware:

```
strata ./my-db branch fork default experiment
strata ./my-db kv put city tokyo --branch experiment
strata ./my-db kv get city --branch experiment   # tokyo
strata ./my-db kv get city                       # unchanged on default
```

Time travel: every write receipt carries a commit `timestamp`; pass it back
with `--as-of` on reads (kv/json/vector/event/graph alike):

```
strata --json ./my-db kv put k v1        # note data.commit.timestamp
strata ./my-db kv put k v2
strata ./my-db kv get k --as-of <t1>     # v1
```

## Output contract

- `--json`: one compact envelope per command — `{"type": ..., "data": ...}`.
  KV keys/values and cursors are base64 strings on the wire.
- `--raw`: script-friendly bare values.
- default: human-readable; binary values decode to text when valid UTF-8.
- Continuation cursors are opaque base64 tokens: pass the printed cursor
  back verbatim via `--cursor`.
- Raw serialized commands (the programmatic path):
  `strata <db> command run --command-json '{"type":"kv_get","key":"a2V5"}'`

## Errors teach

Failures carry a stable code (`<class>.<area>.<detail>`), a one-line hint,
and a per-code ref (`https://stratadb.org/e/<code>`). `--json` failures emit
the full envelope on stderr. Recover by code and class, never by message
text. Full registry: `strata agents errors --json`.

## Diagnostics

`strata doctor [--json] [path]` checks the installation and (optionally) a
database, reporting coded issues with hints; it exits non-zero when
anything needs attention.

## MCP

`strata <db> mcp serve` speaks Model Context Protocol over stdio — ~20
curated tools plus `strata_guide` (this guide) and `strata_command` (any
cataloged command as raw wire JSON). Same envelopes, same error codes.
Client config: {"command":"strata","args":["<db-path>","mcp","serve"]}.

## Command catalog

126 commands carry full metadata today (catalog JSON: `strata agents commands --json`); every command documents itself via `--help`.

## Repo onboarding

`strata agents init` writes `.strata/AGENTS.md` into the current repo; `--apply` also appends a short pointer block to the repo's `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` so every future agent session here starts oriented.
